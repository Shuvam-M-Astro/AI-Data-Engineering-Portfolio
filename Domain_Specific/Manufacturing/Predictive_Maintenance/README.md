# Manufacturing Predictive Maintenance System

## Overview

This module implements a comprehensive predictive maintenance system for manufacturing equipment. The system analyzes sensor data from manufacturing equipment to detect early warning signs of equipment failure, predict remaining useful life (RUL) of components, and provide maintenance recommendations.

## Features

- **Sensor Data Analysis**: Processes temperature, vibration, pressure, speed, current, and voltage readings
- **RUL Prediction**: Predicts remaining useful life of equipment components using Random Forest regression
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies abnormal equipment behavior using Isolation Forest
- **Maintenance Recommendations**: Provides actionable maintenance recommendations based on predictions
- **Visualization**: Comprehensive visualizations for equipment health monitoring
- **Report Generation**: Generates detailed maintenance reports for specific equipment

## Key Components

### 1. PredictiveMaintenance Class

The main class that handles all predictive maintenance operations:

- `generate_synthetic_data()`: Creates realistic sensor data for demonstration
- `preprocess_data()`: Cleans and prepares sensor data for modeling
- `train_rul_model()`: Trains a model to predict remaining useful life
- `train_anomaly_detector()`: Trains an anomaly detection model
- `predict_maintenance_needs()`: Makes predictions and generates recommendations
- `visualize_results()`: Creates comprehensive visualizations
- `generate_maintenance_report()`: Generates detailed maintenance reports

### 2. Sensor Data Features

The system monitors the following sensor readings:
- **Temperature**: Equipment operating temperature (°C)
- **Vibration**: Equipment vibration levels (mm/s)
- **Pressure**: System pressure readings (PSI)
- **Speed**: Equipment operating speed (RPM)
- **Current**: Electrical current consumption (A)
- **Voltage**: Electrical voltage readings (V)
- **Time in Service**: Equipment age (hours)
- **Operating Hours**: Daily operating time (hours)

### 3. Predictive Models

#### RUL Prediction Model
- Uses Random Forest Regressor
- Predicts remaining useful life in hours
- Provides confidence intervals and feature importance

#### Anomaly Detection Model
- Uses Isolation Forest algorithm
- Detects abnormal equipment behavior
- Provides anomaly scores for severity assessment

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from predictive_maintenance import PredictiveMaintenance

# Initialize the system
pm_system = PredictiveMaintenance()

# Generate synthetic data
data = pm_system.generate_synthetic_data(n_samples=10000, n_equipment=50)

# Preprocess data
X, y = pm_system.preprocess_data(data)

# Train models
X_test, y_test, y_pred = pm_system.train_rul_model(X, y)
anomalies, scores = pm_system.train_anomaly_detector(X)

# Make predictions
sample_equipment = data[data['equipment_id'] == 1].iloc[:1]
predictions = pm_system.predict_maintenance_needs(sample_equipment)

# Generate report
report = pm_system.generate_maintenance_report(1, sample_equipment)
print(report)
```

### Running the Demo

```bash
python predictive_maintenance.py
```

## Output

The system provides:

1. **Model Performance Metrics**:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - R-squared (R²)

2. **Maintenance Recommendations**:
   - IMMEDIATE MAINTENANCE REQUIRED - Anomaly detected
   - URGENT - Equipment likely to fail soon
   - SCHEDULE MAINTENANCE - Plan maintenance within 200 hours
   - MONITOR - Equipment showing signs of wear
   - NORMAL - Equipment operating normally

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Temperature vs Time (colored by RUL)
   - Vibration vs Time (colored by RUL)
   - Pressure vs Current (colored by RUL)
   - RUL Distribution
   - Feature Importance
   - Anomaly Detection scatter plot

4. **Maintenance Reports**:
   - Current equipment status
   - Predicted RUL
   - Anomaly detection results
   - Sensor readings
   - Actionable recommendations
