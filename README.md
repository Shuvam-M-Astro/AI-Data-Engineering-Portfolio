# Simple ML Portfolio

A collection of machine learning projects implementing various algorithms and techniques on popular datasets. These scripts were initially created to also be used to quickly monitor performance on new systems. 

## Project Structure

## Projects

### Classification
- **MNIST**: Handwritten digit recognition
- **CIFAR-10**: Image classification with 10 categories
- **IRIS**: Classic flower classification dataset
- **IMDB**: Sentiment analysis on movie reviews

### Regression
- **AIR**: Air quality prediction

### Text Analysis
- **Titanic**: Survival prediction using passenger data

### LLM
- **LangChain**: Chatbot implementation with tools and memory
- **RAG**: Retrieval Augmented Generation system for document-based QA

### Audio Processing
- **SpeechRecognition**: Speech-to-text using Whisper model

### MLOps & Deployment
- **MLOps**: End-to-end ML pipeline with MLflow and DVC
- **ModelServing**: FastAPI-based model serving with authentication

### Bayesian Modeling
- **CLV_Bayesian**: Bayesian regression for Customer Lifetime Value prediction using the UCI Online Retail dataset
- **Churn_Bayesian**: Bayesian logistic regression for customer churn prediction using the Telco Customer Churn dataset

### RPA
- **IMDb RPA Sentiment Analysis**: RPA automation to scrape IMDb's most popular movies and perform sentiment analysis on user reviews
