# ML-Portfolio: Simple Machine Learning Scripts Used To Test Remote Cluster

A comprehensive collection of machine learning projects implementing various algorithms and techniques on popular datasets. This repository serves as a showcase of data science and machine learning skills across different problem domains.
These scripts were initially created to also be used to quickly monitor performance on new systems. 

## Projects

### Classification
- **MNIST**: Handwritten digit recognition
- **CIFAR-10**: Image classification with 10 categories
- **IRIS**: Classic flower classification dataset
- **IMDB**: Sentiment analysis on movie reviews

### Regression
- **AIR**: Air quality prediction

### Mixed Analysis
- **Titanic**: Survival prediction using passenger data

## Project Structure

Each project is contained in its own directory and includes:
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Model implementation and training
- Evaluation metrics and results
- Visualization of results

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Data Processing Libraries (pandas, numpy)
- Visualization Tools (matplotlib, seaborn)
