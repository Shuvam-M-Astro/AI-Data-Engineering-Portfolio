# Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)

This directory contains a comprehensive implementation of UMAP for dimensionality reduction and visualization of high-dimensional data.

## Overview

UMAP is a manifold learning technique for dimension reduction that is both computationally efficient and effective at preserving both local and global structure in the data.

## Features

- **Parameter optimization**: Find optimal n_neighbors and min_dist parameters
- **Visualization**: Plot embeddings with customizable parameters
- **Comparison with other methods**: Compare UMAP with PCA and t-SNE
- **3D visualization**: Support for 3D embeddings
- **Quality metrics**: Calculate embedding quality metrics

## Files

- `umap_analysis.py`: Main implementation with comprehensive analysis tools
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages

## Usage

```python
from umap_analysis import UMAPAnalysis

# Initialize UMAP
umap_analysis = UMAPAnalysis(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.1)

# Find optimal parameters
optimal_n_neighbors, optimal_min_dist = umap_analysis.find_optimal_parameters(X)

# Fit and transform data
embedding = umap_analysis.fit_transform(X)

# Plot embedding
umap_analysis.plot_embedding(X, labels)

# Compare with other methods
umap_analysis.compare_with_other_methods(X, labels)

# Get quality metrics
metrics = umap_analysis.get_embedding_quality_metrics(X)
```

## Parameters

- `n_components`: Dimension of the embedded space (default: 2)
- `n_neighbors`: Number of neighbors to consider for each point (default: 15)
- `min_dist`: Minimum distance between points in the embedded space (default: 0.1)
- `metric`: Distance metric to use (default: 'euclidean')

## Demo

Run the demo to see UMAP in action on various datasets:

```bash
python umap_analysis.py
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: UMAP requires the `umap-learn` package which is included in the requirements.

## Key Advantages

1. **Computational efficiency**: Faster than t-SNE for large datasets
2. **Global structure preservation**: Maintains both local and global structure
3. **Flexible parameters**: Multiple parameters for fine-tuning
4. **Transform capability**: Can transform new data points
5. **Scalability**: Works well on large datasets

## Important Notes

- UMAP requires the `umap-learn` package to be installed
- The algorithm is stochastic and results may vary between runs
- Parameters should be tuned based on the dataset characteristics
- UMAP is generally faster than t-SNE for large datasets
